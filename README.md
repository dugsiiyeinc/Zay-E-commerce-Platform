# Zay E-commerce Platform

Welcome to Zay, an innovative e-commerce platform developed collaboratively by Abdalla Hiil, Abduqadir Mohamud Ali, and Abdullahi Mohamed Yahye. This project represents our first joint effort on GitHub as Team 2 in Group A, where we have combined our expertise to deliver a user-friendly and responsive shopping experience.

## Website Overview

Zay features the following pages:

- **Home Page**: Showcasing featured products and promotions.
- **About Page**: Providing information about Zay and our mission.
- **Shop Page**: Allowing users to browse and search through our diverse product catalog.
- **Contact Us Page**: Enabling users to reach out for inquiries or support.
